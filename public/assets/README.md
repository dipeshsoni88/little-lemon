Images used by the app are stored under `public/assets/images/`.

Files:
- logo.png
- greek-salad.jpg
- bruschetta.jpg
- lemon-dessert.jpg
- customer-placeholder.jpg

To replace with real assets, copy your JPG/PNG files into this folder and keep the filenames above, or update the component image paths in `src/` accordingly.

Note: Files in `public/` are served statically at the root of the app. For example, `/assets/images/logo.png` will be available at `http://localhost:3000/assets/images/logo.png` when running `npm start`.
